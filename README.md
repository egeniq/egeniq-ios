Egeniq Library for iOS projects
===============================

This project contains some of the utility classes we've developed to make our lives easier. And if they make our lives easier, they may also make somebody else happy, so we've decided to make them publicly available.

As-is, no warranties whatsoever, use at your own risk, etc. etc.

Pull requests with improvements are very much appreciated!

* Add a license file (BSD, MIT, something that makes it easy to share)
